League-ish system
Tons and tons of challenges, both global and area specific
Have really powerful tier relics, that dont make you TOO powerful or increase drop rates
	Want the server eco to last longer than the 3 months of leagues
Unlock teleports in areas with area specific "league points"
	i.e 1000 lumbridge points to unlock cow pen teleport
	Can eventually purchase all/most of the teleports after you complete EVERY challenge in an area
$x donation to reset relic/teleport choices
Lets us have crazy and fun items like that teleport crystal from trailblazer
Have more than just 6 tiers of relics
All relics disabled in wilderness, or just against players in the wilderness

This probably should be possible, need to find a way to properly get interfaces from osrs


If league system causes power creep, introduce tiers of bosses
	Hardmode(more health / damage), 
	Endurance (way more health), 
	Gauntlet (multiple bosses at once)
