><Who are you?
Player: Who are you?
Count Check: As you may see, I am a vampyre, from Morytania. I left there when I heard the terrible news and now I choose to spend my days warning others of the perils that lay in wait for them.
Player: The perils?
Count Check: Yes, be warned! The travellers of these lands face danger from outside. Accounts can be stolen, and when that happens one can lose everything one has worked for.
Count Check: I've left my vampyric ways behind me, and now I spend my days letting everyone know of this terrible danger.
Count Check: In return for my dedication, I have been blessed with the ability to check if adventurers are ready to defend themselves against these account thieves.
