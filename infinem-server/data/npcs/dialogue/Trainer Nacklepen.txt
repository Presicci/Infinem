Player: Who are you then?
Trainer Nacklepen: Hurumph.
Trainer Nacklepen: Nacklepen, tortoise trainer extraordinaire.
Player: What's extraordinary about you?
Trainer Nacklepen: Do you know any other tortoise trainers?
Player: Well, no.
Trainer Nacklepen: Well there you go then.
<So what are you training these tortoises to do?
Trainer Nacklepen: Tortoises are naturally pacifistic animals that eat nothing but cabbages. I am required to beat those peaceful tendencies out of the softies and turn them into hardened battle-trained killers.
Trainer Nacklepen: Firstly I acclimatise them to excessive aural stimulation and simple physical confrontation.
Player: You shout at them and beat them with sticks?
Trainer Nacklepen: Of course. Then I re-educate them to become comfortable with riders and military combat situations.
Player: You sit on their backs and prod them with sharp pointy things.
Trainer Nacklepen: If you like.
Player: Doesn't seem very fair on the tortoises.
Trainer Nacklepen: This is war! Fairness is a luxury of the weak.
Player: Hmmm, profound but disturbing.

><Why tortoises?
Player: So why tortoises?
Trainer Nacklepen: Isn't it obvious? Surely even to your untrained eye that giant tortoises are the perfect mobile armoured field unit?
Trainer Nacklepen: They are sturdy animals, and well protected by their shell. They can even swim! All we need to do is put a bit of fire in their bellies.
Player: I suppose so....

><Where did these tortoises come from?
Player: Where do these tortoises come from?
Trainer Nacklepen: We breed them. The originals were found by gnome explorers back in King Healthorg the Great's rule. On their discovery King Healthorg authorised a small party to go there and transport a breeding pair back here.
Trainer Nacklepen: He kept one for himself to ride into battle.
Trainer Nacklepen: Trouble is they take a lot of skill and time to breed, so we're only just getting them battle ready.
