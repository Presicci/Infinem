Player: It's a bit hot and dry round here for a gnome isn't it? I thought you gnomes liked your home comforts.
Wingstone: Certainly I miss home cooking, but gnomes are also fundamentally curious people. I'm here exploring the furthest reaches of the world for the King.
Player: Found anything interesting?
Wingstone: Sophanem is a curious place, if you can get into the blighted place. There are several pyramids round here as well. Fascinating architecture, I've heard stories that some of them contain treasure tombs and mummies.
Wingstone: Cats seem to have considerable importance round here, they certainly seem tied into their religion. The Gods round here seem very alien to me - I've never heard of them before.
Player: Thanks.
