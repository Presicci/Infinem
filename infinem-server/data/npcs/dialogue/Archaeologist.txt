Archaeologist: Hello there.
Player: Hello, what's an archaeologist like yourself doing here.
Archaeologist: I'm stocking up on water before I start my trip down south to the quarry.
Archaeologist: I heard there are ruins around there. Can't pass on an opportunity like that.
Player: Sounds interesting, good luck.
Archaeologist: Farewell.
