Player: Can you ferry me to that island?
Sandicrahb: Most certainly, but my services come at a price... of 10,000 coins
><Who are you?
Player: Who are you?
Sandicrahb: Why bwana, I'm Sandicrahb! I travel far over the ocean from the tropical land of Karamja.
Player: How come you're charging so much?
Sandicrahb: The gold is for a good cause, I promise bwana.
Player: Uh huh, that's a mighty fine gold necklace you have.
Sandicrahb: Well bwana, of course I take a cut, but the funds keep these beaches clean and tidy, I promise!
Player: If you say so...
><Good day to you too.
Player: Good day to you too.
><That's a nice boat!
Player: That's a nice boat! Would be a shame if something were to happen to it.
Sandicrahb: Made from the wood of the Fyburglars tree, strong and light weight! Perhaps if it went missing, I'd find you.
Player: Perhaps.
