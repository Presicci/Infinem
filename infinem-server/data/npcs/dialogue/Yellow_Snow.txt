Yellow Snow: Hey, human.
<Who are you?
Player: Who are you?
Yellow Snow: I am Yellow Snow.
<How did you get called Yellow Snow?
Player: How did you get called Yellow Snow?
Yellow Snow: We trolls are named after first thing we try to eat, an' some things are kinda inevitable in a big snowy land with almost no toilets.
Yellow Snow: We dug smelly hole in prison so Mother's prisoners wouldn't go all over floor, but it not very convenient. Trolls like things convenient.

FIRSTOPTIONS
><Do you like it here?
Player: Do you like it here?
Yellow Snow: Eh, it kinda rough, but it getting better. Snowflake, she taught us goutweed farming. Goat, wolf, human all taste so much nicer with goutweed in.
Yellow Snow: So yeah, Weiss is good place to live, now Snowflake in charge. All trolls like Snowflake. Her husband troll kinda weird, but that not our problem.
