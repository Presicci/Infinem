/Morgiana: Ah, hello again.

(<That armour looks mighty fancy!
Player: That armour looks mighty fancy!
Morgiana: Indeed! A family heirloom of mine, passed down from my father.
Player: Oh? Are you from a family of famous knights?
Morgiana: You could say that...
Player: What's wrong?
Morgiana: Oh, nothing... it's just... old memories. I'm getting old, as you can probably see. My family have all died to war. This is meant to be my retirement.
Player: Retirement? Then why still wear the armour? Especially with how hot it is here.
Morgiana: I find it's best to be prepared in this region. Bandits regularly visit this fine oasis, and they ask fewer questions when they see me in armour.
Player: I see.

><How's the tea here?
Player: How's the tea here?
Morgiana: Hmm...
Morgiana: Umm...
Morgiana: Well... I think it's quite nice! I prefer a warm cup of Saradomin's Wisdom, a special recipe of mine.
Player: Oh? How's it made?
Morgiana: Bit of a family secret. A fine blend of herbs that are quite magical.
Player: Alright then. Keep your secrets.
FIRSTOPTIONS:
><I'd best be off.
Player: I'd best be off.
Morgiana: Quite. Perhaps I'll see you around...

Player: Oh, hey! The door was open...
