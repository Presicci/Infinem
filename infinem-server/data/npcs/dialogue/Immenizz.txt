Player: Hello. So, what is this place?
Immenizz: This is my home, mundane human! What do you have in your pockets? Something tasty?
Player: Stay out of my pockets! I don't have anything that you want.
Immenizz: Ah, but do you have anything that *you* want?
Player: Of course I do!
Immenizz: Then you have something that implings want.
Player: Eh?
Immenizz: We want things you people want. They are tasty to us! The more you want them, the tastier they are!
Player: So, you collect things that humans want? Interesting... So, what would happen if I caught an impling in a butterfly net?
Immenizz: Don't do that! That would be cruel. But chase us, yes! That is good. Implings are not easy to catch. Especially ones with really tasty food.
Player: So, some of these implings have things that I will really want? Hmm, maybe it would be worth my while trying to catch some.
