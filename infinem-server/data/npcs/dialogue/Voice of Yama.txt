Voice of Yama: What is it, human? Speak and begone, your presence disgusts me!
Player: Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
Voice of Yama: Stop your muttering and get to the point!
Player: W-Who are you?
Voice of Yama: I am the Voice of Yama.
Player: Yama?
Voice of Yama: Yama is my master, a powerful demon of fire.
Player: Why can't Yama speak for themself?
Voice of Yama: Currently my master resides below us, building strength. Worry not, human, my master will eventually own your soul too.
Player: I'll be leaving now.
Voice of Yama: I suspect you should.
