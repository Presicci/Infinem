Player: Hiya Hermie!
Herman Caranos: Ah, [player name]! How's the fishing going?
Player: Still working on it. How's the Colony?
Herman Caranos: Flourishing, now that the colonists are coming back! Soon all the finest restaurants will be serving monkfish!
Herman Caranos: It's a pity those skeletons you brought here haven't gone away again, though. They're in the dormitories, which is rather annoying! So please take a little time to kick 'em around a bit.
Herman Caranos: Oh, and please don't call me Hermie.
Player: Whatever you like, Hermie!
