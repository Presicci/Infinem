Player: Are you okay?
Disciple of Yama: Oh yes! Just praying to my new master. It's hot down here, isn't it?
Player: I guess so.
<Your new master, that would be...?
Player: Your new master, that would be...?
Disciple of Yama: Yama! I sold my soul you see, well, I guess that Ox-headed guy down there forcibly removed it.
Player: That doesn't sound like a fair trade...
Disciple of Yama: Oh, don't worry, I'm perfectly fine with the outcome. Sure, the loss of vision is a shame but it could be worse.
Player: Could it?
Disciple of Yama: Underground there are no tall buildings, I'm awfully afraid of heights, you see.
Player: Perhaps it's a good thing you can't see...
Disciple of Yama: What was that?
Player: Oh, nothing...
><What happened to your eyes?
Player: What happened to your eyes?
Disciple of Yama: The ritual, there were some... adverse effects...
Player: The ritual?
Disciple of Yama: Oh yes! Pretty basic really, head of an Ox, bruma roots, lots of fire and of course the human sacrifice.
Player: And at what point did that blind you?
Disciple of Yama: The voice demanded that we stare into the fire until we saw enlightenment.
Player: I guess the fire was pretty bright.
Disciple of Yama: Blindingly so.
Player: Wait! Did you say human sacrifice?
Disciple of Yama: Why, of course! We're Zamorakians, we're evil...
Player: Yeah, I guess that's true.
><Well, I'll leave you to it.
Player: Well, I'll leave you to it.
Disciple of Yama: So soon?
Player: Yep, the demons won't slay themselves.
Disciple of Yama: What demons?
