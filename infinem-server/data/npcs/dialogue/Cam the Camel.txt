Player: I'm sorry to bother you, but could you spare me a little dung?

(Player: If I go near that camel, it'll probably bite my hand off.
Cam the Camel: What was that?
Player: Nothing important.
Cam the Camel: The weather's really hot, don't you think?
Player: Not hot for camels, surely?
Cam the Camel: Are you joking? It's burning hot out here! Sitting by the oasis is the only way to stay cool.

Cam the Camel: Sometimes I wish I could go travelling in cooler places, like all those adventurers I see passing through here.
Player: Well, adventuring's thirsty work as well.
Cam the Camel: Oh, that's a pity.
Cam the Camel: In that case, I'll just stay by this nice cool oasis.
