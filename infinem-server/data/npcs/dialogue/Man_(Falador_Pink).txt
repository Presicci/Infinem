Player: Hello.
Man: Good day, [madam/sir]. What brings you to this end of town?
Player: Well, what is there to do around here?
Man: If you're into Mining, plenty! The dwarves have one of the largest mines in the world just under our feet. There's an entrance in the building just north-east of my house.
Man: If you'd rather enjoy yourself, there's the party room just north of here! Or you might like to climb up onto the city wall - you can get a good view of Falador from there.
Player: Thanks.
