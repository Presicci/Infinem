Tyras guard: What is it?
<What's going on around here?
Player: What's going on around here?
Tyras guard: Sorry, I shouldn't give out sensitive information to civilians. You should go to General Hining, in the camp along the road.
><Do you know what's south of here?
Player: Do you know what's south of here?
Tyras guard: No. We sent a scouting party in that direction, when we first established our camp. Some of the men got lost in the swamps. Eventually we listed them as dead.
Tyras guard: Then suddenly they returned, with a wild gleam in their eyes, raving about gods and snakes and all kinds of madness.
Tyras guard: We had to drive them out, in case their condition infected the rest of the troops. Their wives will be given a full widow pension when we return home.
Tyras guard: General Hining concluded that, whatever is down there, it's not affiliated with any of the elf factions, and it should be left alone.
Player: Thank you.
><I'll leave you alone.
Player: I'll leave you alone.
