Al Shabim: Hello Effendi!
Al Shabim: I am Al Shabim, greetings on behalf of the Bedabin nomads.
<Who are you?
Player: Who are you?
Al Shabim: I am Al Shabim Effendi! I am the leader of the Bedabin peoples!
<Okay Thanks!
Player: Okay Thanks!
Al Shabim: Good day Effendi!
><What is there to do around here?
Player: What is there to do around here?
Al Shabim: Well, we are all very busy most of the time, tending to the pineapples. They are grown in a secret location, to stop thieves from raiding our most precious prize.
><What is this place?
Player: What is this place?
Al Shabim: This is the home of the Bedabin. We're a peaceful tribe of desert dwellers. Some idiots call us 'Tenti's', a childish name borne of ignorance.
Al Shabim: We're renowned for surviving in the harshest desert climate. We also grow the 'Bedabin ambrosia.'... A pineapple of such delicious sumptiousness that it defies description.
Al Shabim: Take a look around our camp if you like!
<Okay Thanks!
Player: Okay Thanks!
Al Shabim: Good day Effendi!
