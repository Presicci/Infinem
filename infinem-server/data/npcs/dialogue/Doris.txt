Doris: Hello again dearie. How are you doing?
<Pretty good!
Player: Pretty good!
Doris: That's good to hear.
><Not too good actually!
Player: Not too good actually!
Doris: Oh well.
><What's it like living so close to the wilderness?
Player: What's it like living so close to the wilderness?
Doris: Oh, it's not all that bad. It was a bit scary at first but as long as I don't go past the warning signs I'm all right.
Doris: It's actually pretty quiet here. I used to live in Lumbridge and, let me tell you, that's the dangerous place for people like me.
Doris: Thieves were picking people's pockets with impunity, and killing them on the streets in broad daylight!
Doris: And there weren't even any guards to protect us! Not that the guards in the other cities do much good to protect people from what I've heard.
Doris: I just thank goodness I haven't got an Attack option any more! I wouldn't last five minutes!
><How did Dave come to be evil?
Player: How did Dave come to be evil?
Doris: Oh, I don't know really. He's always been evil, I think. Maybe growing up so close to the wilderness has affected him in some way.
Doris: When he was little he used to want to go into Edgeville dungeon. You know how kids are, always wanting to be dungeon adventurers! But he didn't want to be a hero, he wanted to be a monster!
Doris: And then he spent all summer building a tree-house. Except it wasn't a tree-house, of course, it was his Tower of Fear!
Doris: Of course I was hoping he'd have grown out of it by now and maybe even left home. But at least it keeps him happy.
