Player: Hello!
Disciple of Yama: Welcome. Have you come to give your soul to the Chasm?
Player: Uh, I believe I'm still using it.
Disciple of Yama: For now. Have you come to prove yourself in combat against the many demons within the Chasm?
Player: ...Perhaps.
Disciple of Yama: My master wishes you not to kill his minions without an agenda. You may only slay within the Chasm that which you have been assigned by a Slayer Master.
Player: That's an oddly specific reason.
Disciple of Yama: I ask no questions of my master, I just inform.
