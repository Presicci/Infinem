Jimmy Dazzler: What's your name and your business here?
Player: My name is [player name], and I have a couple of questions for you.
Jimmy Dazzler: No.
Player: What do you mean by no?
Jimmy Dazzler: That just isn't the ticket. I don't know you nor will I answer any questions. Now get gone from here, you'll attract unwanted attention to me.
Player: As if those 'clothes' you're wearing wouldn't do that already.
