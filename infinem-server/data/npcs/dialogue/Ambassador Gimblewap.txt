Ambassador Gimblewap: I can't believe that I've been made to wait so long.
Player: What are you waiting for?
Ambassador Gimblewap: I have been waiting for an audience with the King for days!
Player: Well, he's clearly a busy man.
Ambassador Gimblewap: Bah! I think he's just trying to insult the gnome nation, by making me wait. The cheek of these humans. Just because they're vertically challenged they think they can ignore us.
Player: I'm not ignoring you.
Ambassador Gimblewap: Hmm. I should be thankful for small mercies, I suppose.
