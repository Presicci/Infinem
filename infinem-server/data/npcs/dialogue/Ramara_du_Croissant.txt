Ramara du Croissant: Can I 'elp you, [monsieur/mademoiselle]?
<You've got an interesting accent!
Player: You've got an interesting accent!
Ramara du Croissant: Oui, I 'ave perfected zis accent for when I worked for my father in Ardougne. He is a baker in ze market, and 'e believes ze customers will think ze bread of higher quality if it is made by a foreigner.
Player: And does that work?
Ramara du Croissant: Perhaps. I do not care for ze bread; it is ze fish zat shall be my future.
Player: Good luck with that!
><Why do you work in a fishing colony?
Player: Why do you work in a fishing colony?
Ramara du Croissant: Ahh, it is because I love ze sea. Ze rushing waters, ze endless horizon - it is beautiful! Also, I like ze fresh fish.
Player: It seems like rather hard work - can't you just get a beach house on Karamja?
Ramara du Croissant: Zat, I am afraid, is not for me an option. Besides, I 'ave read of ze island of Karamja - it is full of ze big green spiders, and I like zem not!
Player: Fair enough.
><No thanks, I'm alright.
Player: No thanks, I'm alright.
Ramara du Croissant: Ahh, farewell.
