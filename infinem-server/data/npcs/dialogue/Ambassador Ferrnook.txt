Player: Hello Ambassador. Are you here visiting King Roald?
Ambassador Ferrnook: Well, in theory, but he always seems to be busy.
Player: You don't seem that upset by that, though...
Ambassador Ferrnook: Oh no, I like travelling, and if you become a diplomat patience is a vital skill.
Player: I'll try to remember that.
