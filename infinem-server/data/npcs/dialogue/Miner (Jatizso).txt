/Miner: Gah! Trolls everywhere. There's no escape!
Player: You could just leave the mine.
Miner: Oh, I'd never thought of that.
/Miner: This place rocks!
Player: No it doesn't, it stays perfectly still.
Miner: Bah! Be quiet, pedant.
/Miner: High hoe, high hoe!
Player: Why are you singing about farming implements at altitude?
Miner: I don't know, I've never thought about it. Ask my Dad, he taught me the song.
/Player: How's your prospecting going?
Miner: Mine's going pretty well.
Player: ...
Miner: Mine? Mine...you get it?
Player: Oh, I got it. That doesn't make it funny though.
Miner: Suit yourself.
/Miner: I've been here for two days straight. When I close my eyes I see rocks.
Player: Why would anyone stay here for so long?
Miner: I fear the outside. I fear the big light.
Player: Oh dear. Being underground for so long may have driven you mad.
/Miner: My back is killing me!
Player: Could be worse, it could be the trolls killing you.
Miner: How very droll.
Player: No, troll.
Miner: Bah! I resist your attempts at jollity.
