ITEMDIALOGUE:10156:Leon is gazing intently at the crossbow in his hands.
<What is this place?
Player: What is this place?
Leon: This is Aleck's Hunter Emporium. Basically, it's just a shop with a fancy name; you can buy various weapons and traps here.
<Can I buy some equipment from the shop then?
Player: Can I buy some equipment from the shop then?
Leon: Oh, this isn't my shop; the owner is Aleck over there behind the counter.
Leon: I experiment with weapon designs. I'm here because I've been trying to convince people to back my research and maybe sell some of my products - like this one I'm holding - in their shops.
Leon: Aleck doesn't seem to be interested, though.

><Can you tell me about your crossbow?
Player: Can you tell me about your crossbow?
Leon: It's good, isn't it? I designed it to incorporate the bones of various animals in its construction.
Leon: It's a fair bit faster than an ordinary crossbow too; it'll take you far less time to reload between shots.
<That's crazy, it'll never work!
Player: That's crazy, it'll never work!
Leon: That's what they said about my wind-powered mouse traps, too.
Player: And did they work?
Leon: Well, they only ran into problems because people kept insisting on trying to use them indoors.
Leon: Anyway, I think my crossbow invention is showing a lot more promise.

><Tell me about the ammo for your crossbow.
Player: Tell me about the ammo for your crossbow.
Leon: Ah, I admit as a result of its... er... unique construction, it won't take just any old bolts.
Leon: If you can supply the materials and a token fee, I'd be happy to make some for you.
Leon: I need kebbit spikes, lots of 'em. Not all kebbits have spikes, mind you. You'll be wanting prickly kebbits or, even better, razor-backed kebbits to get material hard enough.
<Can't I just make my own?
Player: Can't I just make my own?
Leon: Yes, I suppose you could, although you'll need a steady hand with a knife and a chisel.
Leon: The bolts have an unusual diameter, but basically you'll just need to be able to carve kebbit spikes into straight shafts.
Leon: Meanwhile, since you're here, I can make some for you if you have the materials.

><Okay, can you make ammo for me?
Player: Okay, can you make ammo for me?

><I'll be off now, excuse me.
Player: I'll be off now, excuse me.
Leon: Well, if you ever find yourself in need of that innovative edge, you can always find me here.
Player: ... thanks.
