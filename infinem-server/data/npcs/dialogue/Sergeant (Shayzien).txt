Player: Hello. What are you doing here?
Sergeant: We're here to keep the farmers safe from the lizardmen.
Player: There's not many of you though.
Sergeant: Luckily the lizardmen have been focusing their efforts elsewhere. They haven't tried to come up here yet.
Sergeant: If they do, we can quickly call in reinforcements if required.
Player: I see. Well I'd better let you get on then.
