Overseer Khougo: Human. You seem to have found your way into Mistrock. What are you doing here?
Player: Am I not allowed to be here?
Overseer Khougo: Your kind have managed to establish dominion over the vast majority of these lands. Will you not even let us have our small corner in peace?
Player: Is that a no?
Overseer Khougo: Hmph! I can't stop you being here, but I don't have to enjoy your presence.
Player: Is there anything that I can do to change that?
Overseer Khougo: No. Now if this conversation is over, I'm going to have a drink.
