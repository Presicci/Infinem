><So what do you do?
Player: So what do you do?
Nelta of Ralos: I am a nelta in service to Ralos.
Player: What's a nelta?
Nelta of Ralos: We are the faithful servants  of Ralos. We serve in a variety of roles across the Church of Ralos.
Player: So kind of like a priest?
Nelta of Ralos: Yes, I believe that would be the closest comparison to the Church of Saradomin, though I am no expert on their practices.
Nelta of Ralos: Above us mere neltas are the teoki, leaders of the key temples across the kingdom. And of course, above them you have the Teokan himself.
