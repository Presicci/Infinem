Player: What are you doing here?
Lucia: I'm blending in. Scopin' out the place.
Player: Are you preparing for a heist? You're only a kid.
Lucia: Let's just say there are some wealthy people about, with full pockets.
Player: Any tips? I'm not having much luck myself.
Lucia: I'm quite sneaky. Every now and then I'll get their attention so their pockets aren't being so carefully watched.
Player: That is sneaky. I'll keep an eye out for your... distractions.
