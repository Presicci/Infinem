Player: Hello!
Helvia: You do not have an appointment.
Player: Sorry, what?
Helvia: You do not have an appointment.
Player: Appointment for what?
Helvia: An appointment to see the Queen.
Player: How do you know that?
Helvia: First, because it is my job. Second, because she is not in Fortis at the moment.
Player: Oh. Well where is she then?
Helvia: She has important business elsewhere in the kingdom. Perhaps when she returns, you'll be able to see her, or perhaps you won't.
Player: Yes, those generally are the two options.
Helvia: Now, if there's nothing else, please move along.
