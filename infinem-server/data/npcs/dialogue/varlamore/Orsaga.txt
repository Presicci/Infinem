Orsaga: Hi there, friend!
Player: Hello! You're not one of the hunters too, are you?
Orsaga: Oh no, but as someone that makes small soft versions of creatures, this is the place to be.
Orsaga: These books and the hunters' reports all contain lovely details about my subject matter. I might never leave!
Player: I'd imagine this is the place to be for materials too. These hunters seem to find everything!
Orsaga: The cat is a great way to stress test some of the stitching too. He loves having something to play with!
