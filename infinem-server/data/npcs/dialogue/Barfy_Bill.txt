Player: Hello there.
Barfy Bill: Oh! Hello there.
<Who are you?
Player: Who are you?
Barfy Bill: My name is Ex Sea Captain Barfy Bill.
Player: Ex sea captain?
Barfy Bill: Yeah, I bought a lovely ship and was planning to make a fortune running her as a merchant vessel.
Player: Why are you not still sailing?
Barfy Bill: Chronic sea sickness. My first, and only, voyage was spent dry heaving over the rails.
Barfy Bill: If I had known about the sea sickness I could have saved myself a lot of money.
Player: What are you up to now then?
Barfy Bill: Well my ship had a little fire related problem. Fortunately it was well insured.
Barfy Bill: Anyway, I don't have to work anymore so I've taken to canoeing on the river.
Barfy Bill: I don't get river sick!
Barfy Bill: Would you like to know how to make a canoe?
<Yes
