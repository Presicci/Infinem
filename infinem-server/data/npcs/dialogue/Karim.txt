Player: Yes please.
KEBAB:
><What do you think of Ali Morrisane?
Player: What do you think of Ali Morrisane?
Karim: I don't like him. He makes all these claims about being the best salesman in Gielinor, and he even has some thugs that he's hired to threaten us.
Karim: One of them came round here and threatened to cut my head off if I didn't cooperate with them!
Karim: I've also heard some rumours about them from my friend Ali in Pollnivneach...
Player: What sort of rumours?
Karim: Apparently he has men there as well, who have also been threatening people.
Karim: And it's said that they even intend to steal from the ruler of Al-Kharid himself!
Player: Really?
Karim: That's what I've heard. Anyway, are you sure you wouldn't like a kebab?
