Arvel: Good day traveller. You are far from home, what brings you here?
Player: I am a wandering [hero/heroine], I come here in search of adventure.
Arvel: Sounds ghastly, I just want to live in peace.
Player: Unfortunately without people like me, peace doesn't last for long.
Arvel: True, but then again most adventurers cause as much trouble as they put right.
Player: You've got a point there... Hmm...
Arvel: Well, good day traveller. And always do the right thing.
