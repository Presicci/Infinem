Eodan: Hello, thanks for rescuing me. Is there anything I can do for you?
<How did you end up down here?
Player: How did you end up down here?
Eodan: I travelled down here with my friend Olbertus in search for treasure. When we didn't find anything except his strange structure, he decided to prise off a coin from the stone relief in the other room.
Eodan: Before I knew it the entrance had closed and I was stuck down here. I tried calling out to Olbertus but he must not have heard me. I don't know what would've happened if you hadn't shown up and saved me.
Player: Well, it turns out Olbertus was corrupted by the coin he stole, I managed to get the coin from him and returned it to the relief, he should be fine now.
Eodan: That's good news at least.
Eodan: I am quite the proficient tanner, for helping me escape I will offer to tan hides for you. However, they'll be at a slightly higher cost for the convenience of being closer to the source.

><Now that you're free, why don't you leave?
Player: Now that you're free, why don't you leave?
Eodan: To be honest, I tried to set up a Tannery on the surface but business was poor, there aren't a lot of dragons in Kourend.
Eodan: I even heard a rumour that people have learned to tan hides with magic. It's always the same! Magic users stealing jobs from honest tradesman!
Player: Oh, wow! I can see why that wouldn't help business.
Eodan: Anyway, I figured if I was closer to the source of the hides then I might get more business. So I'll try setting up shop down here for a while.
FIRSTOPTIONS:
><Can you tan some hides for me?
EODAN_TAN:
><I'm good thanks.
Player: I'm good thanks.
