Trader Stan: Can I help you?
<Yes, who are you?
Player: Yes, who are you?
Trader Stan: Why, I'm Trader Stan, owner and operator of the largest fleet of trading ships and chartered vessels to ever sail the seas!
Trader Stan: If you want to get to a port in a hurry then you can charter one of my ships to take you there - if the price is right...
Player: So, where exactly can I go with your ships?
Trader Stan: We run ships from Port Phasmatys over to Port Tyras, stopping at Port Sarim, Catherby, Brimhaven, Musa Point, the Shipyard and Port Khazard.
Trader Stan: We might dock at Mos Le'Harmless once in a while, as well, if you catch my meaning...
Player: Wow, that's a lot of ports. I take it you have some exotic stuff to trade?
Trader Stan: We certainly do! I and my crewmen have access to items bought and sold from around the world. Would you like to take a look? Or would you like to charter a ship?
<Yes, let's see what you're trading.
Player: Yes, let's see what you're trading.
