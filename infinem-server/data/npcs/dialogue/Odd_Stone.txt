Odd Stone: Hey, human.
<Who are you?
Player: Who are you?
Odd Stone: I am Odd Stone. Got named after some odd stone thing I found in snowfields south of Weiss.
Player: An odd stone thing?
Odd Stone: Yeah, it were made of stone, and it were odd. Some weird bone-head human saw me trying to nibble it, an' he got really upset an' chased me away. He kinda scary.
Odd Stone: Anyway, my parents, they named me Odd Stone after that, and now we trolls not go anywhere near the place. Bone-head human was, like, really scary! And probably magic.
<Can I go looking for the odd stone?
Player: Can I go looking for the odd stone?
Odd Stone: No, we trolls blocked all routes to snowfields from here. Don't want scary bone-head human coming to Weiss.

Odd Stone: Eh, it kinda rough, but it getting better. Snowflake, she taught us goutweed farming. Goat, wolf, human all taste so much nicer with goutweed in.
Odd Stone: So yeah, Weiss is good place to live, now Snowflake in charge. All trolls like Snowflake. Her husband troll kinda weird, but that not our problem.
