Breive: My nephew Steve <col=0040ff>*hack hack*</col> is one of those Slayer Masters. You know, they tell people what to go kill. <col=0040ff>*cough*</col> I look after this cave for people on assignments like that.
Player: But... that's what they're for?
Breive: They have lives too. They were created for a purpose. But whatever, you can only kill these ones if the Slayer Masters say you can.

Breive: Don't you come lecturing me on <col=0040ff>*cough*</col> air quality, young man - I've breathed smoke all my life, man and boy and <col=0040ff>*euuurgh*</col> and there's no <col=0040ff>*ghhuk*</col> scientific evidence that it's harmful.
