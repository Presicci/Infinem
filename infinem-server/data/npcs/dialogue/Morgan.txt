Morgan: Please please help us, bold adventurer!
Player: What's the problem?
Morgan: Our little village has been dreadfully ravaged by an evil vampyre! He lives in the basement of the manor to the north, we need someone to get rid of him once and for all!
Player: No, vampyres are scary!
Morgan: I don't blame you.
