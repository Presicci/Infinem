Player: What kind of things can I smith?
Master smithing tutor: There are many things you can make, from weapons to your good old fashioned armour.
Master smithing tutor: Weapons are the cheapest to smith. They range from a measly one bar, all the way to three bars.
Master smithing tutor: Armour can be the costliest item to smith, the cost of each item ranges from a measly one bar all the way up to a whopping five bars.
Master smithing tutor: Some weapons and armour, such as darts, will require you to have gained knowledge on how to smith them. This is due to the complex nature of the weapon.
Master smithing tutor: You might find that other items don't require conventional bars you would gather. Some may require you to piece blades back together or even infuse a crystal into a piece of armour.
Master smithing tutor: Is there anything else you want to know?
