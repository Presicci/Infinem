Player: So what do you do?
Meegle: I breed Terrorbirds.
Player: Why are they called Terrorbirds?
Meegle: Well, they're supposed to look terrifying but I think they are rather cute.
Player: I'm sure they are cute, unless they are biting your arm off.
Meegle: Oh they'd never do that - unless I tell them to, of course.
Player: I'd better stay on your good side then!
