Player: Hello. Who are you?
Keith: Hello there. The name's Keith. I'm the farmer here.
Player: You're pretty far out of the way here. How come?
Keith: It's a peaceful life. Out here I can avoid the drama and politics of the big settlements.
Player: Aren't you worried about how close the lizardmen are though?
Keith: The Shayzien troops keep them busy. They've not tried coming up this way.
Player: Fair enough. I'll leave you to it.
