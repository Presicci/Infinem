Player: Who are you?
Freja: I'm Freja the Kyattess of the Fremennik Province, who are you?
Player: Oh me? I'm [player name], an adventurer... I guess.
Freja: You must have done something impressive to gain entry here.

Freja: Ah, fantastic! I've yet to face one myself, but I look forward to the challenge.

><What grand feats are you known for?
Player: What grand feats are you known for?
Freja: Much like you, I have a book or two detailing such things, but it seems to have gone walkabouts.
Player: Anything particularly interesting?
Freja: Pah! All of it is incredibly interesting, I slew the great Smolodin Kyatt that plagued the province for many years, I retrieved the crown of many heads from the snake pit and hunted the silver stag of the western
Freja: provinces.
Player: None of that sounds at all boring, I look forward to finding your book.
Freja: Funny you should mention boars, I'm currently hunting one, well... I was...

><Why are you here?
Player: Why are you here?
Freja: My current quest took me to Acheron, a horribly bitter northern territory, in search for this famous Boar... as big as a hut, so the songs say. Anyway, my companions all met a rather grizzly end, I guess I'm looking for
Freja: new ones.
Player: Take me! I'm great.
Freja: Ha ha ha! You're very new here, you've certainly proved you are a worthy hero, but I'd rather someone with a few more years behind them.
Player: What?! I've literally killed many dragons that threatened to kill everyone, I think I'm ready for a boar hunt.
Freja: Hmm... When it comes time for me to venture back to the Isle of Garmr, I'll consider inviting you.

><Bye!
Player: Bye!
Freja: I'll see you around.
