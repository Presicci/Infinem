Froono: Pretty Trees!
Player: Having fun?
Froono: I'm just looking at the magic trees. I think they're cool.
Player: Well, they are magical. Valuable as well...
Froono: When I grow up I want to chop down trees and make magic bows. Then I'd be rich.
Player: Well, that does seem to be a common career around here.
