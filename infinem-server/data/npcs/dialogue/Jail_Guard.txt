Player: Hi, who are you guarding here?
Jail guard: Can't say, all very secret. You should get out of here. I am not supposed to talk while I guard.
<Hey, chill out, I won't cause you trouble.
Player: Hey, chill out, I won't cause you trouble. I was just wondering what you do to relax.
Jail guard: You never relax with these people, but it's a good career for a young man.
><I had better leave, I don't want trouble.
Player: I had better leave, I don't want trouble.
Jail guard: Thanks, I appreciate that. Talking on duty can be punishable by having your mouth stitched up. These are tough people, no mistake.
