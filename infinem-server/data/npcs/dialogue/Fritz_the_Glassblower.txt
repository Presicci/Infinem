Fritz the Glassblower: Hello adventurer, welcome to the Entrana furnace.
Fritz the Glassblower: Would you like me to explain my craft to you?

Player: Yes please. I'd be fascinated to hear what you do.
Fritz the Glassblower: I'm extremely pleased to hear that! I've always wanted an apprentice. Let me talk you through the secrets of glassblowing.

Player: No thanks, I doubt I'll ever turn my hand to glassblowing.
