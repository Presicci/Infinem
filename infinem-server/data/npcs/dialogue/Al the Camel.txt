/<Ask the camel about its dung.
Player: I'm sorry to bother you, but could you spare me a little dung?
Al the Camel: Are you serious?
Player: Oh yes. If you'd be so kind...
Al the Camel: Well, just you close your eyes first. I'm not doing it while you're watching me!
DUNG:
Al the Camel: I hope that's what you wanted!
Player: Ohhh yes. Lovely.

(Player: If I go near that camel, it'll probably bite my hand off.
Al the Camel: Sorry, were you saying something to me?
Player: No, er, nothing important.
Al the Camel: Never mind, it is unimportant when I have such important matters weighing on my soul.
Player: How important can a camel's problems be?
Al the Camel: Well, you see, there is a camel called Elly. A beautiful, wondrous camel, with hide like spun gold and teeth that shine like an oasis.
Player: ...I see.
Al the Camel: I've written many poems describing her beauty. Would you like to hear one?
Player: It's all right, I'm...
Al the Camel: Shall I compare thee to a desert's day? Thou art drier and more rough-skinned.
Al the Camel: Rough sandstorms shake the cactuses away And summer's heat defers to autumn wind.
Player: Look, I don't really have the time to...
Al the Camel: Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines, With Guthix' gold complexion often dimmed;
Al the Camel: And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or desert's changing course untrimmed...
Player: Please, stop.
Al the Camel: But I've only got six lines left!
Player: That's six too many. If I really want to hear your poetry, I'll tell you, okay?
Al the Camel: Very well. Come back and talk to me if you want to hear more.
(Player: Mmm... looks like that camel would make a nice kebab.
