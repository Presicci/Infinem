Player: Hello.
Leatherworker: Can I help you?
<I'd like you to tan something for me.
TAN:
><What do you do here?
Player: What do you do here?
Leatherworker: Well, I can cure plain cowhides into pieces of leather ready for crafting.
Leatherworker: I work with ordinary, hard or dragonhide leather and also snakeskin. What would you like to know about?
<Ordinary leather.
Player: Ordinary leather.
Leatherworker: I can work one piece of cow hide into ordinary leather. It only costs one piece of gold.
Leatherworker: Is there anything else I can help you with?
FIRSTOPTIONS:
><Hard leather.
Player: Hard leather.
Leatherworker: Hard leather is made by specially treating normal leather by wetting and drying several times.
Leatherworker: It's then treated with pine oils. It's harder wearing than ordinary leather.
Leatherworker: Is there anything else I can help you with?
FIRSTOPTIONS:
><Snakeskin.
Player: Snake skins.
Leatherworker: I can work one piece of snake hide into a snakeskin. It only costs 15 pieces of gold. Snakeskin armour is great for intermediate level rangers and provides more defence than hard and studded leather.
Leatherworker: Is there anything else I can help you with?
FIRSTOPTIONS:
><Dragonhide leather.
Player: Dragonhide leather.
Leatherworker: Dragon leather is made from dragonhides. One piece of hide can be worked into one piece of dragon leather. It costs 20 coins each piece.
Leatherworker: Dragon leather is hard-wearing and has excellent flexibility. You can make strong and supple armour with this.
Leatherworker: Is there anything else I can help you with?
FIRSTOPTIONS:
><I'm bored of leather already.
Player: I'm bored of leather already.
Leatherworker: You may be bored now, but an arrow in the backside will soon fix that!

><No thanks.
Player: No thanks.
Leatherworker: Suit yourself.
