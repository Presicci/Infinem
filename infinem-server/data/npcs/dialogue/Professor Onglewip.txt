Player: Do you live here too?
Professor Onglewip: Oh no, I come from the Gnome Stronghold. I've been sent here by King Narnode to learn about human magics.
Player: So where's this Gnome Stronghold?
Professor Onglewip: It's in the North West of the continent - a long way away. You should visit us there some time. The food's great, and the company's delightful.
Player: I'll try and make time for it. Sounds like a nice place.
Professor Onglewip: Well, it's full of gnomes. How much nicer could it be?
