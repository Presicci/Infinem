Mawrth: Those children are nothing but trouble - if I did not watch them all the time, Seren knows what trouble they would get in to!
Player: They look old enough to look after themselves.
Mawrth: They are only 34 and 38, far too young to be left unsupervised.
Player: Only!?! How old does that make you?
Mawrth: Has no one told you it is rude to ask a lady her age?
Player: Sorry, I wasn't thinking. Anyway... I'd better stop distracting you.
Mawrth: Okay, See you some other time.
