Player: That's a big barrel of wine!
Cassim: Isn't it just! I'm a bit of a connoisseur.
Player: Do you make it yourself?
Cassim: I've dabbled, but this is all imported. I have a connection in the far west who has the best vineyards.
Player: In the west?
Cassim: Yes! A fine Hosidius grape, strong hints of plum and blackberry, very sweet.
Player: Sounds lovely!

><How's the tea here?
Player: How's the tea here?
Cassim: It's fantastic! Ali really knows how to brew a fine tea!
Player: Which is your favourite?
Cassim: Well I've supplied him with a small import of mine. I call the concoction 'Zamorak's Fire'.
Player: Sounds hot!
Cassim: Yes, yes. It has a certain kick to it! Although, it'll keep you safe from fire for a short time after drinking!
Cassim: Great for when dragons attack!
Player: Does that happen often here?
Cassim: You never know... Dragons can be sneaky.
FIRSTOPTIONS:
><I'd best be off.
Player: I'd best be off.
Cassim: May the flames of Zamorak light your path.
Player: Er... yeah...
