<Why what's down there?
Player: Why what's down there?
Sigbert the Adventurer: Salarin the twisted. One of Kandarin's most dangerous chaos druids. I tried to take him on, then suddenly felt immensely weak.
Sigbert the Adventurer: I hear he's susceptible to attacks from the mind. However I have no idea what that means, so it's not much help to me.
><Fear not, I am very strong.
Player: Fear not, I am very strong.
Sigbert the Adventurer: You might find you are not so strong shortly...
