Player: Would you like a redberry pie?
MESSAGE:You see Thurgo's eyes light up.
Thurgo: I'd never say no to a redberry pie! We Imcando dwarves love them - they're GREAT!

><Ask about the Skillcape of Smithing.
HASLEVEL:99:SMITHING
(Player: Can we talk about skillcapes?
Thurgo: What do you need, human?
Player: Now that I am so skilled at Smithing, can I buy a Skillcape of Smithing from you?
Thurgo: I reckon so; we master smiths must stick together! I'll give it to you for just 99000 coins.
<Sorry, that's too much money.
Player: Sorry, that's too much money.
Thurgo: Too much money? A smith of your calibre should be able to make that amount in an hour!
><Of course I'll pay you.

(Player: What is that cape you're wearing?
Thurgo: It's a Skillcape of Smithing. It shows that I'm a master blacksmith, but that's only to be expected - after all, my ancestors were the greatest blacksmiths in dwarven history.
Thurgo: If you ever achieve level 99 Smithing you'll be able to wear a cape like this, and receive more experience when smelting gold ore.
