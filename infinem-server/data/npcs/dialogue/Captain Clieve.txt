Captain Cleive: Hello there. What do you need?
<What is this place?
Player: What is this place?
Captain Cleive: This is one of the lairs of those foul Lizardmen. We've managed to corner these ones so they can't escape.
><Who are you?
Player: Who are you?
Captain Cleive: Cleive. Captain Cleive. Captain in the Shayzien Guard and renowned slayer.
Player: Renowned?
Captain Cleive: Absolutely. I'm part of a great family of slayers. You've probably met a few of them over on the mainland.
><Why are you here?
Player: Why are you here?
Captain Cleive: We learnt of a group of Lizardman Shamans causing trouble on the surface. I led a taskforce out to drive them back into their lair.
Captain Cleive: We suffered many losses but we've now managed to trap them in this cave.
Captain Cleive: We've lost too many men to be able to finish them off but I'm happy for someone else to do it if I feel they're worthy of the challenge.
><Can I fight these Lizardmen?
Player: Can I fight these Lizardmen?
Captain Cleive: Perhaps. I've lost too many men to be able to kill them myself but I'm happy for someone else to do it if I feel they're worthy of the challenge.
Player: What do you define as worthy?
Captain Cleive: You'll need to be on a Lizardman Slayer task.
