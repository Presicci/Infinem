Player: Hello, what's a little boy like you doing down here?
Weve: I ain't no little boy. Me dad, Steve, said I was big enough to take care of these 'ere wyverns, as the pal- palint-palintililiolog- those blokes from the museum are too scared of them.
<Calm down, I was just worried.
Weve: Yeah, whatever. I know how to look after myself, my entire family are slayer guardians or something like that.
><Why are you here?
Weve: To guard the wyverns of course.
Player: Guard them? From what?
Weve: From people like you who just want to kill 'em.
Player: But... that's what they're for?
Weve: They have lives too. They were created for a purpose. But whatever, you can only kill these ones if the Slayer Masters say you can.
><Who are you?
Weve: I'm Weve, son of Steve.
Player: That's... an interesting name.
Weve: Well, it's kinda a family tradition you might say. Plus I'm good at looking after wyverns and fast enough to weave between their legs and not get hurt.
><Ok, bye.
Player: Ok, bye.
