Farolt: Hello there!
Player: Greetings. It's nice to see another adventurer here.
Farolt: Adventurer? No. I'm a natural historian from Varrock. I'm working on a project to research the creatures of Kourend.
Farolt: Don't you think this place is so fascinating? It looks like this cave is a major habitat for the giants.
Player: Yeah, there are many different giants here for sure. How did you manage to get this far? Those giants are quite hostile to visitors.
Farolt: Well, I just ran past them as fast as I could.
Farolt: Anyway, I'd better get back to my research.
